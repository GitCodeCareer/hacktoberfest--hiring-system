### Just try

One important rule all the project and also all Hakctoberfest - "Just try!", if you're not sure you fit this project - "just try!" Don't worry to feel stupid, don't worry to ask stupid question, and try less worry.

Main headline of this project "just try it, just learn it", nobody will punching you in the face, and the most important you will learn a lot of new things as we all. - @igavelyuk
